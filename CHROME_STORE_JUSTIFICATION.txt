TABS PERMISSION JUSTIFICATION (for Chrome Web Store submission form)
================================================================================

The "tabs" permission is used solely to detect browser internal pages
(chrome://, edge://, about:, etc.) where screen savers cannot be activated
due to browser security restrictions.

When users click the extension icon, we read the current tab's URL to check
if it's a restricted page. If so, we display a notification explaining why
the screen saver cannot be used. This prevents errors and provides clear
user feedback.

We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any browsing data. The URL check
happens locally and is only used for feature validation.
